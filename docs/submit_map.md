# Submitting a Map

To submit a new map, you must be logged-in to your GitHub account.
> If you don't yet have a GitHub account, you can register here:

1. Go to create a **[New Issue](https://github.com/past-due/issue_template_test/issues/new/choose)**.
2. On the option titled "**Submit Map**", click the green "**Get Started**" button.
   - This will open the map submission form.
3. **Edit the title** to be `[MAP]: (your map name)`
4. Locate the local map file you'd like to submit.
5. If the filename ends in `.wz`, append `.zip` to the end of the filename (i.e. so it should end in `.wz.zip`).
   > Map files are already zip files that simply end in `.wz`, but GitHub only recognizes them as zip files if the file extension is `.zip`
6. In the "**Upload Map**" text area, click to select the text area.
7. Attach your map `.wz.zip` file to "**Upload Map**" text area.
   > You can drag-and-drop the map file onto the text area, copy & paste, or click the small bar at the bottom of the text area to open a file picker.
   > 
   > For more information on attaching files, see: [GitHub Docs > Attaching files](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/attaching-files)
8. Under the "**Authorship**" option, select the "Mine" option if this map is one you've created / edited / authored.
9. _Optionally_, if you have a description you'd like to associate with the map, you may enter it in the "**Map Description (optional)**" section.
   > Currently, descriptions should be in English.
10. _Optionally_, if you have any additional notes for reviewers, you may add them in the "**Notes for Reviewers (optional)**" section.

Once you've double-checked everything, click the green "**Submit new issue**" button at the bottom of the form.

## What Happens Next

- A new issue will be created in this GitHub repo with your map attached.
- A bot will automatically analyze, process, and validate your map. It will then post a comment to the Issue with a **Status** of `Pass`, or one or more failures.

## If a Map Fails Validation:

The bot will post a comment detailing why there is a failure, along with recommendations to fix it.

Once you have resolved any issues, you may upload a fixed copy of the map by following the instructions posted by the bot.

## Once a Map Passes Validation:

Wait for a moderator to approve your map.
